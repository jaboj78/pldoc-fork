       pom.xml now supports:

	     use "skipJavacc=true"  on the comnmand line 

          file-based integration tests from pldoc_test.sh/pldoc_test.bat

* Changes:
      module HTML pages are now encoded as UTF-8 rather than ISO-8859-1, preventing corruption of module pages
      Bundled example scripts now run against bundled samples directory
      Site menu link to Sourceforge development site corrected



	CHANGES IN RELEASE 0.9.2:

* New: 
       Maven now creates ZIP, TGZ, and TBZ bundles of JAR files, scripts and sample files

* Changes:

* New: Now supported:-
       Collections (see test/TestDoc3/cand2172_tab.html)
       Object Types (see test/testinput/objecttypes, test/TestDoc3/cand2169_t.html)

       Most unreserved words (see test/TestDoc3/pkg_test_unreserved_keyword.html)
       Split operators " 1 ! /* comment ... */ = 2 "  (see test/TestDoc3/split_operators.html)
       Document schema-level functions and procedures within faux-package of the form "_SCHEMA-NAME"
       inline tags (see test/testinput/objecttypes/TY_FIELD_AGGREGATOR.tps, test/TestDoc3/ty_field_aggregator.html)
* New: Maven now creates 2 artefacts (original JAR and a standalone JAR containing all required classes)
* Changed: 
        PLDoc repository moved to Subversion
