Other Databases

The ANT and Maven examples rely on:-
  the appropriate environment shell scripts being run;
  the appropriate JVM (matching any database native libraries); 
  dependent JAR files loaded into any reposiitories.


These examples were tested with:-
TimesTen 11.2.2.*: 
	export TT_HOME=~/TimesTen/tt1122
	.  ${TT_HOME}/bin/ttenv.sh


[
Using TimesTen with ANT requires a 32-bit JVM, because TimesTen libraries are 32-bit only
Otherwise, ANT complains about "problems with loading native library/missing methods: no [ttJdbcCS|ttJdbc] in java.library.path"
]
 

DB2 Express-C 9.7.5
	export DB2_HOME=~db2inst1
	. ${DB2_HOME}/sqllib/db2profile
